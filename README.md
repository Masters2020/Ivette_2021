# Thesis_Ivette_2021

Chronological order of steps in this thesis:
1. Extract the transcripts and add the labels
2. Clean each of the datasets
3. Merge the datasets
4. Preprocess each model according to their own preprocessing steps
5. Tune, train and validate the models

GloVe embeddings can be found here: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

All files needed to execute these steps can be found in this github repository.
