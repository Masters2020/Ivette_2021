(Code for accuracy still needs to be added to the py files of the models)

Chronological order of steps in this thesis:
1. Extract the transcripts and add the labels
2. Clean each of the datasets
3. Merge the datasets
4. Preprocess each model according to their own preprocessing steps
5. Tune, train and validate the models

All the files needed to execute these steps can be found in this github repository.
